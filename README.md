ProxyMachine
============

By Tom Preston-Werner (tom@mojombo.com)


Description
-----------

ProxyMachine is a simple content aware (layer 7) TCP routing proxy built on
EventMachine that lets you configure the routing logic in Ruby.

If you need to proxy connections to different backend servers depending on the
contents of the transmission, then ProxyMachine will make your life easy!

The idea here is simple. For each client connection, start receiving data
chunks and placing them into a buffer. Each time a new chunk arrives, send the
buffer to a user specified block. The block's job is to parse the buffer to
determine where the connection should be proxied. If the buffer contains
enough data to make a determination, the block returns the address and port of
the correct backend server. If not, it can choose to do nothing and wait for
more data to arrive, close the connection, or close the connection after
sending custom data. Once the block returns an address, a connection to the
backend is made, the buffer is replayed to the backend, and the client and
backend connections are hooked up to form a transparent proxy. This
bidirectional proxy continues to exist until either the client or backend
close the connection.

ProxyMachine was developed for GitHub's federated architecture and is
successfully used in production to proxy millions of requests every day. The
performance and memory profile have both proven to be excellent.


Installation
------------

    $ gem install proxymachine -s http://gemcutter.org


Running
-------

    Usage:
      proxymachine -c <config file> [-h <host>] [-p <port>]

    Options:
      -c, --config CONFIG              Configuration file
      -h, --host HOST                  Hostname to bind. Default 0.0.0.0
      -p, --port PORT                  Port to listen on. Default 5432


Signals
-------

    QUIT - Graceful shutdown. Stop accepting connections immediately and
           wait as long as necessary for all connections to close.

    TERM - Fast shutdown. Stop accepting connections immediately and wait
           up to 10 seconds for connections to close before forcing
           termination.

    INT  - Same as TERM


Example routing config file
---------------------------

    class GitRouter
      # Look at the routing table and return the correct address for +name+
      # Returns "<host>:<port>" e.g. "ae8f31c.example.com:9418"
      def self.lookup(name)
        ...
      end
    end

    # Perform content-aware routing based on the stream data. Here, the
    # header information from the Git protocol is parsed to find the 
    # username and a lookup routine is run on the name to find the correct
    # backend server. If no match can be made yet, do nothing with the
    # connection.
    proxy do |data|
      if data =~ %r{^....git-upload-pack /([\w\.\-]+)/[\w\.\-]+\000host=\w+\000}
        name = $1
        { :remote => GitRouter.lookup(name) }
      else
        { :noop => true }
      end
    end


Example SOCKS4 Proxy in 7 Lines
-------------------------------

    proxy do |data|
      return  if data.size < 9
      v, c, port, o1, o2, o3, o4, user = data.unpack("CCnC4a*")
      return { :close => "\0\x5b\0\0\0\0\0\0" }  if v != 4 or c != 1
      return  if ! idx = user.index("\0")
      { :remote => "#{[o1,o2,o3,o4]*'.'}:#{port}",
        :reply => "\0\x5a\0\0\0\0\0\0",
        :data => data[idx+9..-1] }
    end


Valid return values
-------------------

`{ :remote => String }` - String is the host:port of the backend server that will be proxied.  
`{ :remote => String, :data => String }` - Same as above, but send the given data instead.  
`{ :remote => String, :data => String, :reply => String }` - Same as above, but reply with given data back to the client  
`{ :noop => true }` - Do nothing.  
`{ :close => true }` - Close the connection.  
`{ :close => String }` - Close the connection after sending the String.  

Connection Errors and Timeouts
------------------------------

It's possible to register a custom callback for handling connection
errors. The callback is passed the remote when a connection is either
rejected or a connection timeout occurs:

    proxy do |data|
      if data =~ /your thing/
        { :remote => 'localhost:1234', :connect_timeout => 1.0 }
      else
        { :noop => true }
      end
    end

    proxy_connect_error do |remote|
      puts "error connecting to #{remote}"
    end

You must provide a `:connect_timeout` value in the `proxy` return value
to enable connection timeouts. The `:connect_timeout` value is a float
representing the number of seconds to wait before a connection is
established. Hard connection rejections always trigger the callback, even
when no `:connect_timeout` is provided.

Inactivity Timeouts
-------------------

Inactivity timeouts work like connect timeouts but are triggered after
the configured amount of time elapses without receiving the first byte
of data from an already connected server:

    proxy do |data|
      { :remote => 'localhost:1234', :inactivity_timeout => 10.0 }
    end

    proxy_inactivity_error do |remote|
      puts "#{remote} did not send any data for 10 seconds"
    end

If no `:inactivity_timeout` is provided, the `proxy_inactivity_error`
callback is never triggered.

Client Greeting and Server Relay
--------------------------------

Some protocols such as SMTP require a greeting to be sent before the client
sends any data. The server being proxied to would also likely be sending such
a greeting, which would need to be stripped from the output being sent back
to the client:

    client_greeting "220 mx.google.com ESMTP n2sm7419324wfl.1\r\n"

    proxy do |data|
      { :remote => "mail.gmail.com:25" }
    end

    server_relay do |data|
      { :proxy => data.gsub(/^220.*?\r?\n/, '') }
    end

Client Greeting
---------------

`client_greeting` is used to present the client with a banner on connection.
Protocols including SMTP and SSH must send a greeting to the client before
the client will send any data.

Server Relay
------------

`server_relay` is used to filter the real greeting from the server so it 
isn't sent back to the client.

Valid Return Values for Server Relay
------------------------------------

`{ :proxy => String }` - String is the data to be sent to the client before proxying is enabled  
`{ :noop => true }` - Do nothing.
